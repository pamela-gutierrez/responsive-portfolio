            My name is Pamela Gutierrez and I consider myself a jack of many trades! I come from a Social Science background in university but most of my professional life has been spent working in tourism and hospitality in various parts of the world. After graduating from Saint Louis University in Madrid, Spain (the home campus is in Missouri but I've never been there!) I spent the next eight years working in different parts of the world. After some time spent in my native California I eventually went on to spend nearly four years working in Central America. I started receptionist at small hotel in the jungles of eastern Guatemala and eventually transitioned to a full-time tour guiding position leading small group tours from Mexico to Costa Rica. I eventually left this role to pursue new challenges across the world in Australia where I again reprised my role as a tour guide and joined the management staff at YHA Austalia Hostels. After two years and many memories made, I decided to transition yet again, this time closer to family in the San Francisco Bay Area. Though the global pandemic has certainly changed my course, years of moving across the globe have prepared me for new challenges, the most recent of which is coding! I'm currently enrolled full-time at the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp where I am enjoying the challenge and fast pace of the daily work in hopes of preparing myself for a possible future in remote work and maybe someday even the mythical digital nomad life!
